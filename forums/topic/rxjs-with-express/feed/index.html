						<p>Hi</p>
<p>I just attended a conference talking about Functional Reactive Programming in the Netflix API and it&#8217;s pretty cool subject to talk about. I google and found that Rx is also available for Node.js <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS</a> but I don&#8217;t see much blog out there showing show to use RxJS with express.js. It would be cool and very helpful if we have a post explaining the usage of Express.js and RxJS.</p>
